<input> HTML element have onChange method which calls each time when the input text changes. In React it will pass an event object to it's calling function.


concept of controlled components/ Single source of truth:

In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

<form> element defaul behaviour:

form refreshes the page after submitting the form (for eg. after making POST/GET requests). In case we want to prevent it in that case we can do it by following way

function handleSubmit(event)
{
  // after doing all tasks
  .
  .
  .
  event.preventDefault();
}
